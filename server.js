//At the top of your server.js file, require the express and body-parser modules to get started.
//Use express() to create your app object.
//At the bottom of your server.js file, use app.listen to set up your server to listen on a port. We usually use port 3000.
//Run node server.js, npm start, or nodemon in the Terminal to start your server.
//If you gave app.listen a callback with a log message, you should see the log message in your Terminal.
//Go to localhost:3000/ to see another message that lets you know your server is listening (but a bit unhappy).
//In your server code, between the requires and the app.listen, start a section for routes!
//Create a route to handle GET requests at the / path.
//Use a simple res.send to send a message that the route is working.
//Restart your server, reload the page, and you should see the message you sent as a response. Yay!
